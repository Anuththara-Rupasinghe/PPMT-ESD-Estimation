# PPMT-ESD Estimation
## Multitaper Analysis of Evolutionary Spectral Density Matrix from Multivariate Spiking Observations

Description: This repository contains the MATLAB codes that reproduces the results in Section V.A of the paper "Multitaper Analysis of Evolutionary Spectra from Multivariate Spiking Observations".

Instructions: 
1. Download all the codes in a single directory
2. Run the script main.m

Following these steps will regenerate the Figures and results outlined in the Section V.A (Case 1: Latent trivariate process observed through spiking) in the paper. The tasks performed by each function are explained in detail in their headers and comments.
