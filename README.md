## Multitaper Analysis of Evolutionary Spectra from Multivariate Spiking Observations MATLAB Codes

Description: This repository contains the MATLAB codes that reproduces the results in Section V.A of the paper "Multitaper Analysis of Evolutionary Spectra from Multivariate Spiking Observations" (Link: https://128.84.21.199/abs/1906.09359).

Instructions: 
1. Download all the codes in a single directory
2. Run the script main.m

Following these steps will regenerate the Figures and results outlined in the Section V.A (Case 1: Latent trivariate process observed through spiking) in the paper. The tasks performed by each function are explained in detail in their headers and comments. 

This work was presented in part at the IEEE Data Science Workshop, Minneapolis, MN, USA, June 2019:

A.  Rupasinghe  and  B.  Babadi,  “Multitaper  analysis  of  evolutionary spectral density matrix from multivariate spiking observations,” in 2019 IEEE Data Science Workshop (DSW), June 2019 (Link: https://user.eng.umd.edu/~behtash/publications.html).
